# Password-Classifier

The point of this python noteboook is to see how accurate KNN and Naive Bayes are to choosing good and bad passwords

Features

We were only provided a data set that had two features which were passwords and the strength

Calvin Ng and Arturo Delgado decided to add multiple features that differentiate a password.

Final Features

**Passwords : The password that is entered**

**Strength : The Strength is in categories of 0=bad, 1 = medium, 2 = excellent**

**UpperCase : How many Uppercases in the password**

**LowerCase : How many LowerCase in the password**

**Numbers : How many Numbers are in the password**

**SpecialCharacter: How many Special Characters (symbol) there are in the password**

**Length : The overall length of the password**
