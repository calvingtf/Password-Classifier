# Password-Classifier

The point of this python noteboook is to see how accurate KNN and Naive Bayes are to choosing good and bad passwords

Features

Calvin Ng and Arturo Delgado decided to add multiple features that differentiate a password.

**LowerCase : How many LowerCase in the password**

**Numbers : How many Numbers are in the password**

**SpecialCharacter: How many Special Characters there are in the password**

**Length : The overall length of the password**
